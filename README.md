- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shoktapus
- 👀 I’m currently learning a solid programming foundation. I want to learn Ehrlang, Python, and Q and I've become interested in cloud computing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help develop my programming skills. One of my goals is to attain the ability to become a digital nomad. I also enjoy helping people.
